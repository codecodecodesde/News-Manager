## News Manager

### Introduction
News Manager is a  real time news scraping and recommendation system. This system uses a news pipeline to scrape latest news from various of resources such CNN, BBC and Bloomberg etc. To render the news, this system integrates with a single-page web application built by React. In addtion, it supports customizing news list based on news topic for each user. To achieve this function, there is a click event log processor which collects usersâ€™ click logs to updates a news preference model for each user, and an offline training pipeline for news topic modeling.
