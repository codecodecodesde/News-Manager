# News Manager

## Introduction
News Manager is a real time news scraping and recommendation system. This system uses a news pipeline to scrape latest news from various of resources such CNN, BBC and Bloomberg etc. To render the news, this system integrates with a single-page web application built by React. In addition, it generates a customized news list for each user based on news topics. To achieve this function, a click log processor collects usersâ€™ click logs to update a news preference model for each user, and an offline training pipeline models news topics.
